# GodotBlackjackTest
An experiment at making a generic Blackjack simulator in Godot 4.4.1

# WHAT?
Exactly what it says on the tin; nothing special.

# WHY?
I had some ideas for making card games in Godot in the spirit of Hearthstone, MTGO / MTG Arena, etc. but I wanted to get my mind around how Godot structures UIs and underlying engines before jumping into anything major.

I also wanted to give "vibe coding" a shot, since that became popular a couple months ago.  I made something of an 80% solution to a basic Blackjack implementation in Godot thanks to the free version of Claude (I got cut off mid-conversation saying I had to pay to keep using it, otherwise I might have made it more like 95%).  

# HOW?
If you want to play around with it, clone the project and open it up in Godot 4.4.1 or later.
